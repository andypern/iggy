ls bucket/nick

put bucket/nick/stuff

lls bucket/nick

- returns 'stuff'

put bucket/nick/stuff/otherstuff

change slides: maybe replace nfs/smb with 'filesystem' vs 'objectStore'
slide-12 : wan vs lan instead of excel
possibly talk about uses for s3 :

* images/assets for a website
* snapshots/backups of a DB (sql/key-value/mongo/etc)
* immutable large content
*
